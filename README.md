# LoboRaquet Game Engine
![Raquet Game Engine -- Logo by Chris S.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sinislosion/Raquet/refs/heads/master/raquetlogo.png)<br>
A fork of the Raquet game engine implementing modern image file types support!<br>
LoboRaquet stands for "Lobotomized Raquet", a reference to the Raquet wiki saying the only way to add modern image file support is by performing a lobotomy.<br>
